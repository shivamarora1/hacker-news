Doing a (very) soft launch today, mainly because I want to use it to encourage discussion of alternatives.<p>How non.io works:<p>1. Free to browse, paid to interact.<p>2. Minimum subscription is $2 (though you can choose more). I take $1 to run the servers, everything left gets split evenly between everything you upvote that month.<p>It&#x27;s a simple model, but I hope it&#x27;s a better one than the freemium model we&#x27;ve been relying on for the last few years. Fundamentally I feel like any ad-supported network doesn&#x27;t have alignment between the needs of the users and the needs of the platform, which is what drove me to make this.<p>Because this is a soft launch, if you do subscribe I&#x27;d encourage you <i>not</i> to pay for the time being. I&#x27;m still testing the distribution algorithm for returning funds - you won&#x27;t get overcharged or anything, but I just want to guarantee your funds are properly distributed at the end of the month.
